To develop an intelligent image classification system that assists in early detection of breast cancer using automated feature extraction and predictive modeling.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Naïve Bayes Classifier
- Texture Analysis
- Edge Detection
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy & Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Key Features
- Image preprocessing and normalization
- Texture-based feature extraction
- Edge detection for structural analysis
- CNN-based deep feature learning
- Comparative model analysis
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Web-based visualization interface

## Outcome
The system successfully classifies breast cancer histopathology images into benign and malignant categories with optimized model performance.
